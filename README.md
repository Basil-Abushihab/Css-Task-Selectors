# Css-Task-Selectors
# in this task we used css selectors in order to specify specific patterns 
- first doing the zig zag where we needed to alternate between divs making a zig zag shape this was achieved using nth child selectors where we pick out the even numbered divs and gab=ve them a margin-top value in order to change their position to down

- secondly, doing the hide even task where we needed to hide the even positioned divs this was done again using the nth child using even as a condition and setting the display type to none in order to hide these elements

- thirdly, doing the alternating divs where we need to alternate div coloring such that for each row th 4th 5th and 6th elements differ from the rest this was achieved by making 9 groups of three divs and using nth child even in order to manipulate the coloring for the even numbers and maintaining the current color state for the odd divs 

- fourthly, doing the div selection task where we had to apply 5 selections to 5 groups of 11 divs this was done by using multiple nth child condtions.
